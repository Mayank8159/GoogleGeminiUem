### 💡 Pro-Tip for the "Typewriter" Effect:
Since GitHub's Markdown is static, "true" animation usually requires a GIF. However, many developers use a **GitHub Readme Typewriter Service**. 

Would you like me to provide the specific **dynamic URL code** that generates a real-time typing animation for your name and project title?
